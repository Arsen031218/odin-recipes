    <h2>Lasagna Recipe</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground meat - 600 g</li>
        <li>Bolognese sauce - 600 g</li>
        <li>Butter - 60 g</li>
        <li>Wheat flour - 2½ tablespoons</li>
        <li>Olive oil - 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Milk - 750 ml</li>
        <li>Ready-made dry lasagna sheets - 10 pieces</li>
        <li>Hard cheese - 500 g</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a saucepan, combine butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil; melt over medium heat. Gradually add flour, stirring continuously to prevent lumps.</li>
    <li>Once all the flour is incorporated, gradually pour in the milk. Reduce heat and simmer until the sauce reaches the consistency of low-fat sour cream; it should be thick but not solid. Continuously stir the sauce to prevent it from burning.</li>
    <li>In a frying pan, heat some olive oil. Add the ground meat (a mix of pork and veal is preferred).</li>
    <li>Fry the ground meat until it is half cooked, then stir in the Bolognese sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (356°F). Grease a baking dish with butter. Spread a thin layer of béchamel sauce over the bottom to just cover it.</li>
    <li>Layer the uncooked lasagna sheets. Top with the cooked meat, a generous amount of grated cheese, and cover with béchamel sauce.</li>
    <li>Continue layering as desired to ensure the lasagna is moist and juicy. Finish with a layer of dry lasagna sheets.</li>
    <li>Top the final layer of lasagna sheets with béchamel sauce and a generous amount of cheese. Let it rest for 7-10 minutes before baking. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.</li>
</ol>
